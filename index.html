                I'm a professional ecologist in academia with a lifelong interest in nature.

				Relevant background: I grew up in northern Utah interested in herps and insects. 
				My M.S. project was on Phrynosoma mcallii in the deserts of Imperial County, CA. 
				I worked in San Diego area for several years and spent time outside there. 
				I did my PhD project in the Missouri River floodplain on Iowa on anurans and turtles. 
				After my PhD I got heavy into birding and eBird.

            <p>This blog was created for me by my sister, Kaitlyn Ott. She is in a computer science fundamentals class.
                I was nice enough to let her use my pictures and bio so she could create this blog as a school assignment. 
                She is the best sister ever! She also wrote this content in this paragraph. </p>

            Prairie Meadow Katydid

                This is the Prairie Meadow Katydid. 
				The prairie meadow katydid is four-tenths to six-tenths inch long. 
				The wings are about one-fourth the length of the abdomen. 
				The femur (large section of the leg; third leg segment from the body) has two brown stripes with a plain brown section between them. 
				The lifespan of a katydid is about a year.
            </p>
			<p>The lifespan of a katydid is about a year. 
                Females usually lay their eggs at the end of summer beneath the soil or in plant stems. 
                The eggs are typically oval and laid in rows on the plant. Most katydids overwinter in the egg form. 
                The males have sound-producing organs on their front wings. 
                They use this sound for courtship. During courtship there often is antennal contact between male and female. 
                Katydids are eaten by birds and mammals and may be the target of insect predators and parasites including horsehair worms, wasps and flies. 
                The prairie meadow katydid lives on grasses growing on dry, poor soil. It seems to prefer areas of sandy soils. 
                Singing occurs from August through September.</p>

        <h2>Corn Earworm Moth

				Corn earworm is found throughout North America except for northern Canada and Alaska. 
				In the eastern United States, corn earworm does not normally overwinter successfully in the northern states. 
				It is known to survive as far north as about 40 degrees north latitude, or about Kansas, Ohio, Virginia, and southern New Jersey, depending on the severity of winter weather. 
				However, it is highly dispersive, and routinely spreads from southern states into northern states and Canada. 
				Thus, areas have overwintering, both overwintering and immigrant, or immigrant populations, depending on location and weather. 
				In the relatively mild Pacific Northwest, corn earworm can overwinter at least as far north as southern Washington.
